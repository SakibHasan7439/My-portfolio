Hello! I’m [Your Name], a passionate frontend web developer with a keen eye for design and detail. Currently, I’m a university student, where I’m honing my skills in web development. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with hands-on experience using CSS libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap to create responsive and visually appealing websites.

Over the past year, I’ve worked on various projects, from dynamic web applications to portfolio websites, each time striving to deliver clean, efficient, and user-friendly code. My journey into web development started with a simple curiosity, but it quickly turned into a passion for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences.

My goal is to continue learning and evolving as a developer, with a particular interest in mastering advanced JavaScript frameworks and enhancing my UI/UX design skills. I’m excited about the future of web development and am always eager to take on new challenges.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring the latest design trends, contributing to open-source projects, and expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
